My name is Carsen, and I am currently a junior at NYU studying game design and computer science! 

### More Information

I am experienced in making games, web design, and programming with languages like C#, Java, Javascript, and more. I am unsure what else to put here, so I will add that I have a cat named Theo. That is all.
